              Aayaam is the Hindi Literary and Cultural Society of National
              Institute of Technology Tiruchirappalli. This literary group was
              the first of its kind in Tamil Nadu and the whole of South India,
              where Hindi is not widely spoken. The motive behind establishing
              Aayaam was to promote the love for Hindi in Trichy in general and
              NIT Trichy in particular.

            <p>
              Umang, a Hindi week, is celebrated by Aayaam on the Hindi Day at the NIT Trichy campus.
              <br><br> The objective of the Hindi week is to enrich the Hindi language in non-Hindi speaking societies and increase their curiosity towards the Hindi language. The inclination of today's generation to move towards western culture has reshaped the need for activities that make people aware of their culture. With this goal, the event Umang was started.
              <br><br> More than 500 participants of the institute become a part of various events every year.

            <p>
              Dandiya Night, the much-awaited event of Aayaam, is organised annually on the auspicious occasion of Navratri, where various students come in ethnic attire and enjoy Gujarati culture and dance with their friends.
              <br><br> Goodies are also given to the students for the best ethnic wear. The primary purpose of this festival is to show respect to Maa Durga on the auspicious occasion of Navratri. 
              <br><br> It was initiated in 2010 with a view that students who are more inclined towards western civilisation and culture should not forget their tradition.

            <p>
              On the night before Holi, all the members gather to celebrate Holika Dahan and perform rituals in front of a bonfire and pray that their inner evil is destroyed in the same way as Holika was consumed by fire.

              <br><br> The next day, colours and water tanks are arranged for all the people eager to celebrate Holi so that people play Holi among themselves. People apply colours to each other and enjoy the festival. Playing Holi amongst one another increases harmony and friendship.
